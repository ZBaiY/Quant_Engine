This logging system must satisfy:

1. Unified across backtest, mock, and live
No “mode-specific” logs.
Only the LoggingPolicy / logger factory chooses different verbosity or handlers.

2. Deterministic
Backtest logs must be deterministic (same seed, same output).

3. Execution-Pipeline Visibility
You need automatic log lines for each stage:
ExecutionPolicy → Router → SlippageModel → MatchingEngine → Portfolio
…without every class manually rewriting logging boilerplate.

4. Structured
Every log line must contain:
```
timestamp | level | module | message | context (json)
```
So you can later parse it with pandas or BigQuery if needed.

5. Lightweight
Logging must be fast enough not to break live trading latency.
